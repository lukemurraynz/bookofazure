Before a chapter, you might find a few different elements in a book:

Title page: This is usually the first page of the book and includes the book's title, author's name, and publisher's information.

Copyright page: This page follows the title page and includes the copyright information, such as the copyright holder, year of publication, and any legal notices.

Dedication or epigraph: Some books may include a dedication or epigraph, which is a short statement or quotation that is usually located on its own page before the first chapter. The dedication is typically a personal message from the author to someone special, while the epigraph is a quote that sets the tone for the book.

Table of contents: This is a list of all the chapters and sections in the book, usually found at the beginning of the book. It helps readers navigate the book and find specific sections easily.

Foreword or preface: A foreword or preface is usually written by someone other than the author and provides context or insight into the book's content. It typically appears before the first chapter and is sometimes used to acknowledge individuals who helped with the book's creation.

After these elements, the book's first chapter usually begins.
